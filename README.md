ðŸ“§ Spam Message Detection using Machine Learning

This project is a Spam Detection System that classifies SMS messages as Spam or Not Spam (Ham) using Natural Language Processing (NLP) and various Machine Learning algorithms.

ðŸ”¹ Features

Dataset Preprocessing

Cleaned SMS data (lowercasing, removing punctuation, numbers, and stopwords).

Lemmatization for better text normalization.

Feature Extraction

Used TF-IDF (Term Frequency â€“ Inverse Document Frequency) to convert text into numerical features.

Machine Learning Models

âœ… Naive Bayes Classifier

âœ… Logistic Regression

âœ… Random Forest Classifier

âœ… Support Vector Machine (SVM)

Evaluation

Compared models based on Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score.

Visualized results using Confusion Matrix Heatmap, Correlation Heatmap, and Word Clouds.

Interactive Testing

Added function to test custom messages:

print(predict_spam("Congratulations! You won a free iPhone. Call now!"))  
# ðŸš« Spam  

print(predict_spam("Hey, are we meeting tomorrow?"))  
# âœ… Not Spam  


Model Persistence

Saved trained model (spam_model.pkl) and vectorizer (tfidf_vectorizer.pkl) for reuse.
